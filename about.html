        <p>I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington but am currently an undergraduate at Bennington College in Bennington, Vermont where I'm studying computer science and astrophysics.</p>
        
        <p>This is a website I made, partly to re-teach myself HTML and CSS, but also to put my artwork and projects up onto as well as various references for myself and others to use. It is very much so an ever-on-going work in progress.</p>
        
        <p>This site was written using <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> on a computer running Arch Linux, which I use as a daily driver. The images on the site were created and edited using <a href="krita.org">Krita</a> and most of the digital art I make is made in it as well, although in the past I primarily used Adobe Photoshop.</p>
        
        <p>The source code for this site is availble in full on <a href="https://github.com/vpascow/vpascow.github.io">github</a> and is hosted using github Pages.</p>
