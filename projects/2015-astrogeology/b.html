        <h1>55 Cancri b</h1>
        <p>This planet was discovered in 1996 using the radial velocity method. It has not been observed in transit, although in 2012 there were observations suggesting that its atmosphere transits the star.</p>
        <p>The planet is a gas giant and is orbiting just close enough to 55 Cnc to be warmed enough by the star to 'puff up', something that is seen in Hot Jupiters but not seen in the gas giants in our solar system. A consequence of these planets being so close to their stars is that their atmosphere slowly evaporates, although this planet's atmosphere is evaporating much more slowly than other observed Hot Jupiters. It is thought that there is a 'critical point', a distance at which gas giants orbiting too close to their stars star to lose their atmosphere. It is possible, then, that 55 Cnc b is orbiting near this critical point.</p>
