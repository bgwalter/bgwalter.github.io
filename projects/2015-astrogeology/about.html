        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This site was created by Brendon Walter in June, 2015 as a final project for Astrogeology. </p>
        <p>Click any of the above planets to learn more about it.</p>
        <p>I had some challenge deciding the best way to represent the planets. There is only one planet in this system that we currently know the size of, and that is 55 Cnc e because we were able to observe the planet using the transit method, which gives us the size of the planet (as opposed to the radial velocity method which gives us the mass of a planet). </p>
        <p>So while I would have liked to illustrate the planets above by their actual size, this is currently an impossibility. Because every planet has been observed via radial velocity, the mass of each planet is known. For this reason, the size of each circle representing a planet is determined by its mass. However, there were some additional difficulties with this: 55 Cnc d is 1000 times the mass of 55 Cnc e, and so would need to be 1000 times bigger in this illustration. I opted to use a logarithmic scale to counter this. Some of the finer details were lost in drawing them, but the take away is that the planets are sized logarithmically relative to one another in terms of their mass.</p>
        <p>No attention was given to their relative spacing in this illustration.</p>
