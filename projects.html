        <h1>Data Structures in C - Fall 2014</h1>
        
        <h2>N-body problem: Brute Force</h2>
        <a href="images/portfolio/dataStructures_bruteForce.gif"><img src="images/portfolio/dataStructures_bruteForce.gif" width="200" align="right"></a>
        <p>For a final project, I wanted to create an implementation of the Barnes-Hut algorithm for the N-body problem. Unfortunately, I did not have time to finish this, but I was able to succesfully implement it via brute force.</p>
        <p>This simulation was done in only two dimensions, and the gif on the right shows  the results with 500 bodies.</p>
        <p>Although the course itself was taught in C, I took the time to learn some C++ for this project. The full source code will be up on github.</p>

        <h1>Web As Artistic Platform - Fall 2012</h1>
        
        <h2>Personal Site</h2>
        <a href="http://student2.bennington.edu/~bwalter"><img src="images/portfolio/webAsArtisticPlatform_personalSite.png" width="200" align="right"></a>
        <p>As a part of Web As Artistic Platform, students were required to make a personal site - a site which would act as a 'homepage' for us to put all of our work for the term onto, as well as any other work we wanted.</p>
        
        <br>
        
         <h2>NOLI ME</h2>
        <a href="http://student2.bennington.edu/~bwalter/Final%20Project/index.html"><img src="images/portfolio/webAsArtisticPlatform_noliMe.png" width="200" align="right"></a>
        <p>This site came about through a misunderstanding of an assignment... </p>
        <p>I was inspired by <a href="http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org/">jodi</a> to play around with hiding messages within the site, both on the webpage itself and in the source code.</p>

        <h2>The Final Frontier?</h2>
        <a href="http://student2.bennington.edu/~bwalter/Final%20Project/index.html"><img src="images/portfolio/webAsArtisticPlatform_final.png" width="200" align="right"></a>
        <p>For my final project for Web As Artistic Platform, I decided to create a site which would give information about the solar system - specifically to encourage space exploration.</p>
        <p>This is a project I am planning on continuing working on, and did so a bit in my final project for Astrogeolgy in Spring, 2015.</p>
