			<h2>Venus</h2>
		
			<p>For a long time, people have talked about the possibility of colonizing Venus, but in recent years, after the discovery of the hostile atmosphere, people have stopped looking at Venus as a potential place to colonize and have instead turned their eyes towards other bodies.</p>
		
			<h2>What drew people towards Venus?</h2>
		
			<p>Venus is only slightly smaller than Earth and is the closest planet to Earth. A similar size means that humans living on Venus would not have much trouble returning to Earth as their bodies won’t have started to deteriorate due to a lighter gravitational pull. The surface gravity is very close to that of Earth: 0.904 g.</p>
			<p>Venus is also easier to get to than any other planet. This is for several reasons; mainly because it’s closer (our probes took slightly over 5 months to reach Venus) and because the launch window is every 584 days (compared to 780 days for Mars.)</p>
		
			<h2>If it’s so easy to get to, why did people start looking elsewhere?</h2>
		
			<p>The surface of Venus is very hot and dangerous. The thick atmosphere is made up of about 97% carbon-dioxide and traps the heat of the sun on the planet’s surface. As a result, the surface temperature of Venus can reach up to about 500 degrees Celsius and the extreme temperatures and pressure have destroyed most probes that have tried to land on the surface after only a few hours.</p>
			<p>In addition to the heat, settlers would have to deal with high wind speeds. The top layer of clouds travel at a speed of 360 kilometers per hour. However, near the surface, the wind only moves at a few kilometers per hour. Venus is also covered in volcanic activity.</p>
		
			<h2>Will we ever be able to live on Venus?</h2>
		
			<p>Not with our current technology, but one day we might be able to.</p>
			<p>Methods of making Venus inhabitable include terraforming, cooling the surface by placing solar shades between the planet and the sun, and colonizing the atmosphere at around 50km above the surface because the pressure and temperature this high above the surface are very Earth-like.</p>
