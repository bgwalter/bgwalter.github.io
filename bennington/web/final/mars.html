			<h4>Mars</h4>
		
			<p>Mars is most likely the first planet other than Earth in which humans will inhabit. Already, we have two rovers on the surface of Mars along with three orbiters surveying the planet from orbit.</p>
			<p>In addition to hosting human life at some point in the future, Mars is a likely candidate in our solar system where extra-terrestrial life may be found.</p>
			
			<h4>What makes Mars a good planet to colonize?</h4>
			
			<p>Mars is similar to Earth in a lot of ways! These include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The Martian day is only about 38 minutes longer than a day on Earth</li>
					<li>Mars has an axil tilt of 26.19 degrees (compared to 23.44 degrees on Earth). This means that Mars has seasons similar to seasons on Earth</li>
					<li>The Martian year is 1.88 Earth years, so almost twice as long</li>
					<li>Mars has a thin atmosphere that helps to protect it from solar and cosmic radiation</li>
					<li>NASA has confirmed the presence of water on Mars</li>
				</ul>
				
			<h4>Sounds good! What are the problems?</h4>
			
			<p>There are a lot of problems that would make the colonization of Mars difficult.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The surface gravity is 38% of the Earth’s (making a 150lb person on Earth weigh 56.5lbs on Mars) however, it is not yet known if the pull of gravity will be strong enough to prevent health problems that arise with weightlessness.</li>
					<li>The surface of Mars is significantly colder than on Earth. The mean temperature is -63 degrees Celsius.</li>
					<li>The only known water on Mars is frozen</li>
					<li>Humans cannot survive without a pressure suit</li>
					<li>The atmosphere cannot be breathed by humans as it is mostly made up of carbon dioxide</li>
				</ul>
