			<h6>Saturn</h6>
			<p>Saturn is the second largest planet in the solar system and is also the second largest gas giant. Its volume is 755 times greater than that of Earth. The weather on Saturn is fairly extreme and contributes to the appearance of the planet as the heat rising from the planet combined with the 500 m/s winds (about 5 times faster than the fastest winds on Earth) gives the yellow and gold bands to appear in the atmosphere.</p>
			<p>Like Jupiter, Saturn’s atmosphere is made up of mostly hydrogen and helium, the former of which can cause a deadly explosion when combined with oxygen. </p>
			<p>Colonizing Saturn itself would be a difficult task as any person trying to get to the surface would have to deal with faster than hurricane-speed winds. Orbiting the planet is a possibility, but even more likely is the colonization of the moons of Saturn, including Titan. </p>
