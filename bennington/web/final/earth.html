			<h3>Earth</h3>
			<p>Earth is the only known place in the universe that holds life. It is currently home for ~8.7 million known species.</p>
			<p>The length of a day on Earth is about 23.934 hours while a year is approximately 365.26 days.</p>
			<p>The force of gravity is 9.8m/s^2</p>
			
			<h3>So what's the problem with Earth?</h3>
			
			<p>With an ever-growing population, it is vital that humans find more areas for humans to live and where we can grow food for our large (over 7 billion people) population. There are non-colonized places on Earth where it is possible to fit population overflow, such as in floating cities on the ocean, but that is not a permanent solution. After the oceans are covered, where will we go?</p>
			<p>There are other problems as well, climate change being the biggest. Some problems that will come with climate change include higher temperatures; changing landscapes; extinction of wildlife; rising sea levels destroy costal cities; increased risks of drought, fire, and floods; stronger storms creating more damage from storms, more heat related illness and disease, and economic losses</p>
			<p>With 100 million people living within three feet from sea level, the melting of artic ice and a rising sea level would displace millions of people. By 2100, sea levels are expected to rise between 8 inches and 6.6 feet. If floating cities are the solution, engineers will have to take into account having extra room for not only an exponentially growing population, but also a large number of people whose homes were flooded.</p>
			
			<h3>But isn't space travel incredibly impractical?</h3>
			
			<p>Yes! But unless we start pushing out to space soon, we will have even more problems by the time we need to leave or face extinction.</p>
