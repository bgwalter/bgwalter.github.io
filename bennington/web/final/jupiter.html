			<h5>Jupiter</h5>
			<p>Jupiter is the largest of all the planets in the solar system. It is twice as massive as all the planets in the solar system combined, is 318 times larger than the Earth, yet it is less dense than the Earth due to it being a gas giant.</p>
			<p>Landing and colonizing Jupiter would be impractical and mining could be dangerous – oxygen mixed with the hydrogen of Jupiter’s atmosphere would cause a deadly explosion. There are some gases in the atmosphere that would be good to mine, however, including helium-3 which could be used for nuclear power.</p>
			<h5>Is mining all that Jupiter is good for?</h5>
			<p>Not necessarily. People in the future can use the gravity from Jupiter to give them a boost to getting to other, more distant planets. Because it is in the center of the solar system, it makes a good halfway point and for this reason, having a space station orbiting Jupiter could act as a place for space ships to rest, refuel, and gather supplies.</p>
