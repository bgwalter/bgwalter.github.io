			<h7><strong>Uranus</strong></h7>
			<p>Uranus is not a possible place for humans to colonize for a variety of reasons:</p>
			<p>First off, Uranus is a gas giant. Any form of solid ground to stand on would be so near the core that the pressure would crush any person trying to go there.</p>
			<p>If people could somehow survive the pressure, there would be other factors trying to kill anyone trying to inhabit Uranus. The wind speed is up to 250m/s, or 560mph, meaning that any structure would be blown away.</p>
			<p>The cold is another issue, as Uranus has the coldest atmosphere in the solar system: the minimum temperature for Uranus is -224 degrees Celsius.</p>
			<p>Its atmosphere is made up of hydrogen, helium, ammonia, methane, and water in the form of ice.</p>
			<p>Uranus would be deadly for anyone trying to colonize it. Unless technology improves in such as way that we are able to withstand extreme pressure, cold, and wind, we will not be able to live on Uranus.</p>
