			<h1>Mercury</h1>
			
			<p>Mercury is the closest planets to the sun and is one of the few bodies in the solar system to have a magnetic field (the others being Earth and Jupiter’s moon, Ganymede) which protects it from solar radiation which can be deadly to humans. However, the magnetic field is only 1% of that of Earth.</p>
			
			<h1>What are the problems with Mercury?</h1>
			
			<p>Because Mercury is so close to the sun, it takes a large amount of energy to both land on and leave from Mercury because the gravitational pull of the sun is so strong. Also, the planet turns very slowly and what is one day on Earth is almost 176 days on Mercury. The result is a planet that has temperatures of up to 427 degrees Celsius during the day, and a lack of atmosphere allows the heat to escape during the night, dropping the temperature down to -179 degrees Celsius. Any human settlement would most likely be places near the poles where the temperature tends to be around 0 degrees Celsius.</p>
			
			<h1>Are there any redeeming qualities about Mercury?</h1>
			
			<p>Yes, Mercury is mineral rich and would be an excellent planet to harvest solar energy. A solar plant could harvest 6.5 times the amount of energy that can be harvested on the Earth. There may even be places near the poles on Mercury where the sun is always in the sky where solar plants can work all day to get energy.</p>
			<p>The surface of Mercury has many valuable resources, including helium-3 (which may be an important source to make clean nuclear fusion energy, though its existence on Mercury has not been proven), iron, magnesium silicates, and it is thought that it has the highest concentration of valuable minerals than of anywhere else in the solar system.</p>
			<p>Rather than making Mercury a place of humans to live, it would make more sense to use Mercury as a mining planet.</p>
