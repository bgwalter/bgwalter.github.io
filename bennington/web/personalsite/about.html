     <h1>About the site and its author</h1>

     
        <p>This site was created by Brendon Walter as an assignment for his Web as Artistic Platform class at Bennington College in the fall of 2012.</p>
        <p>The author, Brendon Walter, was born in Seattle, WA in 1994 and has lived there his entire life. He attended and graduated from The Bush School in 2012 and moved to Bennington, VT to attend college.</p>
        <p>His passions include drawing, theater, reading, hiking, rock climbing, video games, and inane surfing of the internet. Brendon is both transgender and gay, and is fairly active in the GSM (Gender & Sexual Minority) community.</p>
        <p>The background for this site is a picture of Lake Washington, taken by Brendon one morning after staying up all night to watch the sunrise, another favorite past-time of his during the summer.</p>
