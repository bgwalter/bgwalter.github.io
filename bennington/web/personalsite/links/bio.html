<p>By the time I was born, my family had three cats. Bert and Ernie were <br>brothers, while <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Cd7h7.jpg">Twitso</a> was my mom’s old cat from before my parents 
<br>were married. As a child, I was terrified of Twitso, and I wasn’t the only 
<br>one. My brother shared my terror of our cat, and when friends came 
<br>over, the infamous tales of Twitso ensured that they, too, would refuse <br>to go near our cat.</p>

<p>For the most part, we had good reason to be afraid of Twitso. While,
<br> according to my mom, she was kind as a kitten, old age made her a grumpy <br>and all around mean-spirited cat. Despite my best attempts to pet her, she 
<br>did not appreciate them and more than once I ran away with the shell of a 
<br>claw imbedded in the back of my hand. </p>

<p>She would tolerate me petting her head, but if I ever tried to pet her <br>back, she would whirl around with a hiss and try to scratch my outstretched <br>hand. Yet despite all the scratches, she was still my cat and a part of the <br>family, and I loved her.</p>

<p>It was when I was in second grade that she died. I stayed home from <br>school with strep throat that day and said goodbye to Twitso before my dad <br>took her in the cat carrier to put her down. In her sickness, she couldn’t get 
<br>the energy to attack my hand while I petted her back for the first and last 
<br>time. When my dad returned from the vet a while later, the cat carrier was 
<br>empty. Twitso was dead.</p>

<p>Two days later, we were driving to Big White to go skiing with our 
<br>extended family. As I sat in the car and looked out the window into the starry <br>night, I saw what I now know to be a satellite. At the time, I had no idea that <br>satellites could be seen by naked eye from the surface of the Earth and <br>imagined it was Twitso, staying with us even after death.</p>
