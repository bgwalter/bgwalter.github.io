<p>Included in the information for Mars will be information and links to the Mars One project, which plans to put humans on Mars by 2023.</p>

<p>It will be possible to click on the moons of each planet to get information about each of them. Every planet (and the sun) is clickable, and there will be information about dwarf planets, asteroids, and human structures.</p>

<p>The large question mark at the top will give general information about space travel, such as why it's important, what problems there are (distance, health, money, time), and links to where I gathered my information.</p>
