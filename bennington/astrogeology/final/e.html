        <h1>55 Cancri e</h1>
        <p>55 Cnc e is the only planet in this system to be observed using both the radial velocity and the transit method. As a result, it's the only planet that we know the actual physical size of rather than just its mass.</p>
        <p>Twice as big and eight times more massive than the Earth, 55 Cnc e is known as a "Super Earth" - a planet that is larger than the Earth but smaller than the gas giants. Despite it being known as a super Earth, it would to habitable to any life as we know it. The planet orbits around 55 Cnc A at a distance 0.016 AU and one year on the planet is completed in only 18 hours. Due to its close proximity to its star, the planet is tidally locked. Observations of the planet show that only one side, the side facing the star, is hot (around 3900 F or 3140 C) while the other side is quite cold. This effect is likely from a lack of a significant atmosphere which would be able to pull the heat to the cold side of the planet.</p>
        <p>Originally, 55 Cnc e was thought to be a 'water world', based on the assumption that its chemical makeup was similar to Earth. Further research showed that it is most likely a 'diamond planet' - about one third (equivalent to three Earth masses) of the planet is likely made up of carbon. </p>
        <p>This planet could resemble what Neptune would look like if it was moved close to the sun.</p>
